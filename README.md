# Campspot-Assignment
Python modules and test cases for Campspot coding assignment.

# How to build and run the program
1) Install Python 3.
2) Clone this repo.
3) Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the repo.
4) Execute the reservation_solver.py script with a required input file argument and an optional minimum_reservation_length argument of 1, 2, or 3. E.g. "python reservation_solver.py test_modules/test_cases/test-case.json", "python reservation_solver.py test_modules/test_cases/test-case.json -mrl 1" If you have not added python 3 to your system path, you may need to give the absolute path to python 3 in the command like "C:\Users\matth\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37\python reservation_solver.py test_modules/test_cases/"
5) The program will print the names of the campsites which are valid for the given data.
